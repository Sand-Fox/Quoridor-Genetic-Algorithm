## Introduction
Quoridor is a 9x9 plate game opposing 2 or 4 players. We will considerate here the 2 players variante.
The objective of the game is to reach the other side of the board before your opponent reach your's. 
Each turn you can whether move or place a wall between two case to block your opponent in his path.
It is important to notice you cannot "close" your opponent path, there must always be a path from one side to the opposit one.

## General info
This project is an online adaptation of the renowned board game Quoridor.
It provides online multiplayer, advanced AI and a genetic algorithm to determine the best parameters for the enemy AI.

This project was originally implemented by [Nino Sandlarz](https://github.com/Sand-Fox), [Henri Besancenot](https://github.com/BlackH57) and [Zhichun Hua](https://github.com/ZhicoH) as part of the double degree in maths and computer science at Sorbonne University. The project was then taken over and pushed forward by [Nino Sandlarz](https://github.com/Sand-Fox) and [Marina Secord](https://github.com/Lyrdinn) during the 1st year of the master's degree in video games at Cnam-Enjmin.
